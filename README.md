Parallel Computer: Performance and Power Consumption Evaluation of OpenMP and MPI

The following files implements three different benchmarks to measure performance on MPI and OpenMP. 
Each file was developed on C++.

The Sample Data for all implementation can be found in Sample Data folder
  1. lady1000.bmp (sample data for Image Averaging Filter Benchmark)
  2. float.zip (sample data for Dense Matrix-Matrix Multiplication Benchmark)
  3. data.zip (sample data for Parallel Merge Sort Benchmark)

Folder MPI_windows_codes
  In this folder, you can find the three adapted benchmarks used on MPI. 
  1. FitMPI.c: Image Averaging Filter Benchmark
  2. MulMatMPI.c: Dense Matrix-Matrix Multiplication Benchmark
  3. Merge.c: Parallel Merge Sort Benchmark
  Also, you can find a image for being used with FitMPI.c 
  
Folder OpenMP_windows_codes
In this folder, you can find the three adapted benchmarks used on OpenMP. 
  1. FiltOpenmp.c: Image Averaging Filter Benchmark
  2. MulMatOpenMP.c: Dense Matrix-Matrix Multiplication Benchmark
  3. mergeOpenMP.c: Parallel Merge Sort Benchmark
